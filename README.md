# PROGRAMMING PA4

### Project Overview
This project involves data wrangling and data visualization using the **ECE Board Exam Dataset**. The goal is to clean and analyze the data, and create meaningful visualizations that highlight key insights. Specifically, the analysis will focus on how different factors like gender, track, and hometown influence the average score. The final output will be a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process and findings.
##### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM
1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
- *Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as
Instrumentation and hometown Luzon*
- *Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is
constant as Mindanao and gender Female*
2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade. Does
chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score?


## Instructions
- Download the ECE Board Exam dataset from this.
- Write Python code in a Jupyter Notebook to solve the given problems.

## Visualizations
The project will include visualizations such as:

Bar charts comparing the average grades based on gender, track, and hometown.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between the variables and the average score.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
1. Identify the Python functions and libraries necessary for cleaning and visualizing data.
2. Apply and implement Python functions to create a program that wrangles and visualizes data.
3. Present insights through storytelling with the aid of data frames and visual representations.


## Conclusion
In this experiment, you'll apply data wrangling techniques and create visual representations to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. The findings from this analysis can help identify patterns and factors contributing to the students' performance in the board exam.
